# Letter of Acceptance

This plugin adds the ability to create letters of acceptance for publishers.

## Usage

**Important** This plugin is in beta and is not finalized!

Once installed either on a journal basis, or upon activating site-side open the plugin settings and
enter a template for your Letters Of Acceptance.

Then upon viewing submissions through the backend a new button for "Letter of Acceptance" will
be available, opening a generated letter which can be saved and sent to the author
in question.
